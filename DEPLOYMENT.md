# 🚀 Deployment Guide - Netlify

This guide will help you deploy your PLP Task Manager application to Netlify.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ Node.js (v18 or higher)
- ✅ Git repository with your code
- ✅ Netlify account (free)
- ✅ Application built successfully

## 🛠️ Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Netlify CLI (Recommended)

1. **Install Netlify CLI globally**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Netlify**:
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

3. **Deploy from your project directory**:
   ```bash
   # Build the project
   npm run build
   
   # Deploy to Netlify
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts** to complete the deployment.

### Method 2: Netlify Web Interface

1. **Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)** and sign in
2. **Click "New site from Git"**
3. **Connect your Git provider** (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
4. **Select your repository**
5. **Configure build settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: `18`
6. **Click "Deploy site"**

### Method 3: Drag and Drop

1. **Build your project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)**
3. **Drag and drop the `dist` folder** to the deploy area
4. **Your site will be deployed automatically**

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

### `netlify.toml`
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### `public/_redirects`
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## 🔧 Build Configuration

The application is configured for optimal production builds:

- **Vite**: Fast build tool with optimized bundling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Purged and minified for production
- **React**: Optimized with production settings
- **Routing**: SPA routing with fallback to index.html

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

- ✅ **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for better performance
- ✅ **Tree Shaking**: Unused code elimination
- ✅ **Minification**: CSS and JavaScript minification
- ✅ **Gzip Compression**: Automatic compression
- ✅ **Caching**: Optimized caching headers

## 🌐 Environment Variables

If you need environment variables, add them in Netlify:

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Add your variables:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL=your-api-url` (if needed)

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

Once connected to Git:

- **Automatic builds** on every push to main branch
- **Preview deployments** for pull requests
- **Rollback capability** for previous deployments
- **Build logs** and error tracking

## 📱 Custom Domain

1. Go to **Domain settings** in Netlify
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS settings
4. Enable HTTPS (automatic with Netlify)

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Code committed to Git repository
- [ ] Build command tested locally (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Netlify account created
- [ ] Repository connected to Netlify
- [ ] Build settings configured
- [ ] Site deployed successfully
- [ ] Custom domain configured (optional)
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (automatic)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard

### Routing Issues
- Ensure `_redirects` file is in `public/` folder
- Verify `netlify.toml` redirects configuration
- Check that React Router is properly configured

### Performance Issues
- Enable gzip compression
- Check bundle size
- Optimize images and assets

## 📈 Monitoring

Netlify provides:
- **Build logs** and deployment history
- **Performance metrics** and Core Web Vitals
- **Error tracking** and monitoring
- **Analytics** (with Netlify Analytics)

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, your application will be available at:
- **Netlify subdomain**: `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`
- **Custom domain**: `https://your-domain.com` (if configured)
